# Error Analysis and Fix

I see the issue in your `count_letters` function. The error occurs because you're trying to increment a value in the `letters` dictionary for a key that doesn't exist yet. When you try to access `letters[lower_char]` for the first time, Python raises a `KeyError` because that key hasn't been created.

Let's fix the `count_letters` function:

```python:stats.py
def count_words(text):
    words = text.split()
    return len(words)

def count_letters(text):
    letters = {}
    for char in text:
        lower_char = char.lower()
        if lower_char.isalpha():
            # Check if the key exists, if not initialize it to 0
            if lower_char not in letters:
                letters[lower_char] = 0
            letters[lower_char] += 1
    return letters
```

Alternatively, you could use the `get()` method or `defaultdict` from the collections module. Here's the fix using `get()`:

```python:stats.py
def count_words(text):
    words = text.split()
    return len(words)

def count_letters(text):
    letters = {}
    for char in text:
        lower_char = char.lower()
        if lower_char.isalpha():
            # Use get() with a default value of 0 if the key doesn't exist
            letters[lower_char] = letters.get(lower_char, 0) + 1
    return letters
```

Either of these solutions will fix the `KeyError` by properly initializing the count for each letter before incrementing it.

great, explain why isalpha is needed if at all

# Explanation of `isalpha()` in the `count_letters` Function

The `isalpha()` method is used in your `count_letters` function for an important reason:

It filters the characters in the text so that only alphabetic characters (letters) are counted in the dictionary. This is necessary because:

1. Text often contains many non-letter characters like spaces, punctuation, numbers, and special symbols (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)

2. Without the `isalpha()` check, your function would count all these non-letter characters in your statistics, which would likely not be what you want if you're specifically trying to analyze letter frequency.

For example, in a sentence like:
```
"Hello, world! This is a test. 123"
```

With the `isalpha()` check, you only count: h, e, l, l, o, w, o, r, l, d, t, h, i, s, i, s, a, t, e, s, t

Without it, you would also count: spaces, commas, exclamation points, periods, and numbers.

If you specifically want to count only letters (which is common in letter frequency analysis), then the `isalpha()` check is definitely needed. If you wanted to count all characters, you could remove it, but that would give you different statistics that might be less useful for text analysis.
